## ONGOING PROJECTS

### FORMATION OF POPULATION III STARS IN SMALL SCALES
To understand the formation of the first galaxies and black holes, it is important 
to study the properties of Population III stars such as their masses and multiplicity. 
Using high-resolution simulations, I am investigating how various physical processes 
affect the fragmentation of disks and therefore the formation of Population III stars.    

### FORMATION OF POPULATION III STARS IN COSMOLOGICAL SCALES
Photons emitted by Population III stars and their remnants travel large distances 
without being absorbed and build a radiation background. This radiation background 
affects the formation of other Population III stars and their properties. In addition, 
this feedback loop reinforces as new stars form. Using cosmological simulations, 
I try to understand the formation of Population III stars in a cosmological context.
