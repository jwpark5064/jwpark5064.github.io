<h3> JONGWON PARK </h3>
I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Astronomy at Yonsei University. I got my bachelor's and master's degree from Yonsei University in South Korea and worked on various topics of galaxy evolution with professor Sukyoung K. Yi. I moved to the University of Maryland, College Park in 2018 and worked on the formation of Population III stars with professor Massimo Ricotti. After I got my Ph.D. degree in May 2024, I returned to Yonsei University and I am currently working with professor Taysun Kimm and Sukyoung Yi on various topics of galaxy formation.    <br><br>
    
My research interest includes the formation of metal-free and metal-poor stars, and their impact on the formation of the first galaxies and dwarf galaxies.  To study them, I make use of hydrodynamics code RAMSES and carry out computer simulations. My job includes implementing various physics (chemistry, radiative processes, etc.), performing simulations using a supercomputer, and understanding the results physically. <br><br>
