## RADIATIVE FEEDBACK FROM POPULATION III PROTOSTARS
The movie shows radiative feedback of a wide eccentric Pop III binary
presented in [Park et al. (2023a)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.521.5334P/abstract){:target="_blank_"}.
At the pericenter, the tidal force between the circumstellar minidisks boosts
the accretion onto the central protostars. When the accretion rate exceeds a
critical value, the protostars become bloated and the temperature drops. Due
to this effect, the stars emit fewer UV photons and the surrounding gas cools down.
As the stars move away from each other and the accretion rate drops, radiative feedback
begins again.
