### JONGWON PARK
I am a Ph.D. candidate of Astronomy Department at the University of Maryland, College Park.
I got my bachelor's and master's degree from Yonsei University and worked on various topics of galaxy
evolution with professor Sukyoung K. Yi. After working as a research assitant, I moved to the University
of Maryland and started my new graduate school life.

I'm studying the formation of the first stars and galaxies with professor Massimo Ricotti. I'm using
RAMSES.
